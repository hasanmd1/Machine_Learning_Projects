# Credit Card Fraud Detection and Risk Management System


## Overview


This project is an advanced fraud detection and risk management
system designed to identify fraudulent activities in financial
transactions. The system leverages various machine learning
techniques, including anomaly detection, time-series analysis,
and transfer learning, to provide a robust solution for
detecting and mitigating fraud. Additionally, it offers insights
into customer behavior, risk scoring, and the potential impact of
fraud on customer lifetime value.


## Features


### 1. Anomaly Detection
The system utilizes advanced anomaly detection algorithms
to identify unusual patterns in transaction data, flagging
them as potential fraud cases.

### 2. Transaction Risk Scoring
Each transaction is assessed and assigned a risk score based
on its likelihood of being fraudulent.

### 3. Time-Series Fraud Detection
By analyzing transaction data over time, the system can detect
fraud that may be hidden within temporal patterns.

### 4. Customer Segmentation for Fraud Risk
The system segments customers based on their transaction
behaviors and associated fraud risks.

### 5. Feature Importance and Explainability
Utilizing machine learning models, the system provides insights
into which features (e.g., transaction amount, time, location)
are most indicative of fraud.

### 6. Real-Time Fraud Detection System
The system is designed to operate in real-time, allowing for
immediate detection and response to fraudulent activities.

### 7. Multi-Label Classification
In cases where transactions may display multiple types of
fraudulent behavior, the system uses multi-label
classification techniques to assign multiple fraud categories
to a single transaction.

### 8. Customer Behavior Profiling
The system builds profiles of customer behavior based on
historical transaction data.

### 9. Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and Fraud Impact
The project includes a model for predicting Customer Lifetime
Value (CLTV) while assessing the potential impact of fraud on a
customer's value to the business.

### 10. Transfer Learning for Fraud Detection
To enhance fraud detection performance, the system incorporates
transfer learning techniques, leveraging pre-trained models from
related tasks.
